## Express
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications. Following are some of the core features of Express framework.

#### Basic Routing
We have seen a basic application which serves HTTP request for the homepage. Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on)

```
Request & Response
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
   // --
})
```

#### 
```
$ npm install express --save 
$ npm install body-parser --save
$ npm install cookie-parser --save
$ npm install multer --save
$ npm install nodemon --save-dev   //Nodemon restarts the server automatically
```
